# COVID-19 Vaccine Notes

## Vaccine Information

### Pfizer-BioNTech
Development was started on 10 January 2020. It uses their existing mRNA technology to produce a recognizable piece of the Coronavirus.

#### Concerns
> This vaccine requires storage at extremely cold temperatures. How does this work for facilities without the required cold storage facilities?

This vaccine needs to be stored at temperatures between −80 and −60 °C (−112 and −76 °F),[32] until five days before vaccination. This temperature can readily be achieved with dry ice (-109.3 °F). [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfizer-BioNTech_COVID-19_vaccine#cite_note-Vaccination_Storage-33)

> In some videos, it can be seen being unboxed and no ice / fog is seen which means it must be warm and therefore not effective.

This vaccine must be thawed to room temperature and diluted with normal saline before administration. These videos were likely taken immediately prior to distirbution for injection. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfizer-BioNTech_COVID-19_vaccine#cite_note-FDAEUA-10)

### Moderna
The Moderna vaccine works in the manner as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The notable difference is that the Moderna vaccine has stabilized the mRNA structure such that it does not require the deep freeze supply chain that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine requires (although cold storage is still required).

### Johnson & Johnson
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is an adenovirus-based vaccine. It uses an adenovirus to induce an immune response. It only requires a single shot and does not require the same extreme temperatures as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. **This vaccine is currently experiencing manufacturing delays and is not expected to be available until April at the earliest.**

## Vaccine Comparison

| Vaccine           | Efficacy | Number of Doses To Date | Side Effects |
|-------------------|----------|-------------------------|--------------|
| Pfizer-BioNTech   | 95 %     | > 2 million             | 21 - anaphylaxis, 4 - temp. Bell's Palsy |
| Moderna           | 94.1 %   | > 4 million             | 10 - anaphylaxis, 4 - temp. Bell's Palsy |
| Johnson & Johnson | 90+ %    |

**Total in the US To Date: >19.8 million**

## General

It should be noted that both vaccine types are relatively new technologies that do not have a significant track record in humans.

### mRNA Vaccines

Unlike previous vaccines that utilize a weakened or inactive virus, mRNA vaccines cause some of the cells around the injection site to produce a special protein for a short amount of time (until the mRNA instructions have been depleted). These proteins trigger an immune response causing the immune system to 1. figure out how to create antibodies to remove the protein and 2. actually produce the required antibodies (which then remain in circulation). These proteins are extremely similar to the proteins found on the outside of the coronavirus. The result is an immune system that already has some tools to fight the virus and the ability to quickly make more.

#### Concerns
> If I get a vaccine, can't I infect others from the vaccine?

No, these vaccines do not contain the live virus, just instructions to create a very small (but recognizeable) part of the virus.

> Don't these vaccines alter my DNA? That's bad right!?

No, these vaccines do not alter your DNA. While mRNA is generated from DNA, there are significant differences. The mRNA of the vaccine never enters the nucleus of your cell (where the DNS is stored). mRNA is also a one-time use set of instructions...once used to build the protein, the mRNA begins to degrade and cannot be used again. [source](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html)

> This is a new vaccine technology.

While this is a relatively new technology, it has been in development since the early 1990s. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_vaccine)


### Adenovirus Vaccines

Adenovirus vaccines utilize a genetically modified adenovirus to induce an immune response to both the adenovirus itself as well as the target virus (in this case COVID-19). The adenovirus itself has man-made deficiencies which limit the ability of the virus to replicate well in the human body leading it to eventually be destroyed by the body, however the antibodies generated during the infection are long lasting. The benefits of the an adenovirus vaccine compared to an mRNA vaccines are 1. they induce strong innate and adaptive immune responses (require a single injection) and 2. they have a much higher thermostability (not requiring the intense cold storage of the mRNA vaccines).
