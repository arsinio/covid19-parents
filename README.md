# How to Convince Your Parents to Vaccinate

## Vaccines

### Currently Available

#### Pfizer-BioNTech
Development was started on 10 January 2020. It uses their existing mRNA technology to produce a recognizable piece of the Coronavirus

##### Concerns
> This vaccine requires storage at extremely cold temperatures. How does this work for facilities without the required cold storage facilities?

This vaccine needs to be stored at temperatures between −80 and −60 °C (−112 and −76 °F),[32] until five days before vaccination. This temperature can readily be achieved with dry ice (-109.3 °F).

> In some videos, it can be seen being unboxed and no ice / fog is seen which means it must be warm and therefore not effective.

This vaccine must be thawed to room temperature and diluted with normal saline before administration. These videos were likely taken immediately prior to distirbution for injection. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfizer-BioNTech_COVID-19_vaccine#cite_note-FDAEUA-10] (source)

## General

### mRNA Vaccines

Unlike previous vaccines that utilize a weakened or inactive virus, mRNA vaccines cause some of the cells around the injection site to produce a special protein for a short amount of time (until the mRNA instructions have been depleted). These proteins trigger an immune response causing the immune system to 1. figure out how to create antibodies to remove the protein and 2. actually produce the required antibodies (which then remain in circulation). These proteins are extremely similar to the proteins found on the outside of the coronavirus. The result is an immune system that already has some tools to fight the virus and the ability to quickly make more.

#### Concerns
> If I get a vaccine, can't I infect others from the vaccine?

No, these vaccines do not contain the live virus, just instructions to create a very small (but recognizeable) part of the virus.

> Don't these vaccines alter my DNA? That's bad right!?

No, these vaccines do not alter your DNA. While mRNA is generated from DNA, there are significant differences. The mRNA of the vaccine never enters the nucleus of your cell (where the DNS is stored). mRNA is also a one-time use set of instructions...once used to build the protein, the mRNA begins to degrade and cannot be used again.

> This is a new vaccine technology.

While this is a relatively new technology, it has been in development since the early 1990s. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_vaccine](source)
